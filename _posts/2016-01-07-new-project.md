title: New Project!

Right.. So I've been without a projet for a few hours now, *let's make something else*.

-----

So I want to create something other than a platformer, and having thought a bit about it, I feel like making something like The Binding of Isaac. I'm probably not going to conquer randomly generated levels, and I'm probalby not even going to use it. What I think I'll do instead is having a couple of different variatons of the rooms (Where the doors will be placed), and from there with the right combinations you can make  quite a few different level designs. 
<br>
Because I don't want to copy The Binding of Isaac completely, I don't think I'm going to have floors as such, but I will still try to implement bosses in whatever way I can.

I'll keep this blog updated with my progress.
