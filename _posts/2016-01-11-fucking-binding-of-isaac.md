title: Fucking Binding of Isaac...
---

*New project.. again*

-----

So remember that Binding of Isaac game, I was making? Yeah I've stopped already.<br>At first it was quite fun making, and by that I mean the different room system, which I made in a very simple manner, I just made a function for assigning a value to doors, and reading that to go to said room. And it was also quite fun making the top down movement, even though I had a bit of trouble getting it to work properly. It became boring as soon as I was finished making my enemies. And by then I started rethinking the entire game, because it was not going to be fun to make. I ended up trying to make the game World War II styled, where the player is a war doctor, who doesn't kill but instead tries to help. I didn't really get started doing this because it was lacking gameplay.<br>So I started making a different game, i went on to twitter and found [Game Idea Machine](https://twitter.com/gameideamachine), where I found this particular [post](https://twitter.com/gameideamachine/status/680538522382659585), and I think I'm going to be making something like that.
