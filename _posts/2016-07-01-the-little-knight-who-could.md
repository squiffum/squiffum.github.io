title: The Little Knight Who Could
---

*Remember that game I talked about in my 'Hello World' post a couple of days ago?* Well I've finished it.

I you haven't checked out Jack 'N' Jill (A one-button platformer for both Android and IOS), you definitely should. Anyways the game I've is a simplified version of that. You can check the game out on my website [here](http://squiffum.ga/the_little_knight_who_could/). The only button you need to press is the spacebar to jump.<br>
Please do give me feedback on the game using the contact form on my website [here](http://squiffum.ga/#contact).
