title: Hello World!

*Hello everyone*, don't worry I'm here now.
I'm squiffum, the worst video game developer and designer you'll ever come across.

I'm a 15 year old boy from Denmark. When I'm not in school and when I'm putting aside making homework, I like to develop websites and games. I have always wanted to program games, but it has - until recently - been impossible for me since I didn't know how to, and the tutorials I watched, I didn't understand. <br>
So one day when I was searching around the web for some new tutorials, and had set on making an html5 game, I came across this awesome thing called [Phaser](http://phaser.io/), and after researching it a bit I found a book called '[Discover Phaser](https://www.discoverphaser.com/)', and as soon as I had gotten my hands on it I started reading it. I finished it in about two days, and had mad the game they taught you which is a clone of [Super Crate Box](http://www.supercratebox.com/), and it was just so fun making it that I immediately started making a clone of a super fun one-tap platformer called Jack 'N' Jill (You can download it on both android an IOS). So that's what I'm doing right now, I'll post an update when I have completed it. <br>
By the way I have - along with this blog - launched another site. A sort of main site. On that site I will post all the games I make, you can visit it right now by clicking [here](http://squiffum.ga/).
